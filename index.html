        <h1>A Authentic<br><span>City Life.</span></h1>
        <p>Times Square, square in Midtown Manhattan, New York City, formed by the intersection of Seventh Avenue, 42nd Street, and Broadway. Times Square is also the centre of the Theatre District, which is bounded roughly by Sixth and Eighth avenues to the east and west, respectively, and by 40th and 53rd streets to the south and north, respectively.
          
        </p>
        <p>Cities have existed for almost as long as humans have, and the best city breaks provide a pleasing look at a wide array of humanity and culture. Though natural beauty can and does coexist with people in urban spaces, you likely aren't going to New York City just to see Central Park. Culture is center stage here and in cities across the world, offering up food, art, theater, dance, music, architecture, literary heritage, history, as well as a lot of other people.</p>
